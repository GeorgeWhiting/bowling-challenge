# Makers Academy Weekend Challenge 5 - Bowling Challenge

Week 5 - Intro to javascript

Challenge - Solo over one weekend - Write a javascript app to calculate the scores from a 10-pin bowling game for one player

### To run:
- clone this repository
- cd bowling-challenge
- open src/intex.html in browser
- reload the page to reset the scores

### To add:
- buttons for each number of pins (think like a darts score calculator)
- an reset button
- private methods
- a summary screen at game-end

### To fix:
- can currently bowl 0 > 10 and have it count as a strike instead of a spare
