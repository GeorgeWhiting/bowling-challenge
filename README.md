# Bowling challenge
Write a javascript app to calculate the scores from a 10-pin bowling game for one player


## To run:
- clone this repository
- open src/intex.html in browser
- reload the page to reset the scores

## To add:
- buttons for each number of pins (think like a darts score calculator)
- an actual reset button
- private methods
- a summary screen at game-end
- make a ui
- multiplayer????

## To fix:
- can currently bowl 0 > 10 and have it count as a strike instead of a spare
